## PocketLines

This a simple chatting app built using an implementation of Action Cable and Rails 5. Users can sign up and log in with a username. They can then create a chatroom or enter an existing chatroom and message each other in real time.

This app was built using the walkthrough provided by Sophie DeBenedetto at [her Heroku blog](https://blog.heroku.com/real_time_rails_implementing_websockets_in_rails_5_with_action_cable).

To run locally you will need

* Ruby 2.3.0
* Postgres
* Redis

Once you clone this repo:

* `bundle install`
* `rake db:create; rake db:migrate`

Thank you.
